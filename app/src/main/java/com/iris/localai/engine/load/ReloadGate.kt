/**
 * 1.7.7: makes "a request" and "a tier reload" mutually exclusive as whole operations.
 *
 * Before 1.7.7 the tier reload only looked at EngineManager's busy flag, which a request sets
 * once it holds the generation lock. A chat request spends time before that (ensureLoaded, context
 * planning, summary) — if the debounced reload fired in that window it unloaded the engine under
 * the already-accepted request. When that reload did not end with a loaded model (cancelled by
 * another tier change → Idle, or failed → Failed) the queued request found `engine == null` and
 * ended as "模型未加载": the first message after a tier change failed, the next one reloaded and
 * worked.
 *
 * Now:
 *  - a request is registered from its very start ([request]) until it ends;
 *  - a reload may only begin when no request is registered ([tryBeginReload]); otherwise the
 *    scheduler defers it and runs it when the last request leaves ([onIdle]);
 *  - a request that arrives while a reload runs waits for it ([waiting] > 0 → UI shows
 *    「正在重载模型…」) and then starts by itself — never dropped, never failed for the race.
 *
 * Pure (no Android), unit-tested in V177Test.
