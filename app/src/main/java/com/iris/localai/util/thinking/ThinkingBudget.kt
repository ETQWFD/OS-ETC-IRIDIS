/**
 * 1.7.8: reasoning gets its own budget instead of eating the answer's maxNewTokens.
 *
 * Done in Kotlin, no native change: the engine is asked for `answerLimit + budget` tokens, and this
 * meter watches the stream. GGUF and MNN emit about one piece per token, so pieces are counted as
 * tokens (LiteRT pieces can be longer — there the engine cap still bounds the total).
 *  - reasoning passes [budget] while the block is still open → [Verdict.THINKING_EXHAUSTED]: the
 *    caller stops the engine and writes the answer with thinking off (the 1.7.7 continuation, which
 *    then has the full answer limit);
 *  - the answer reaches [answerLimit] → [Verdict.ANSWER_EXHAUSTED]: the caller stops and reports
 *    LENGTH, exactly as if the engine had hit maxNewTokens on the answer alone.
 * [budget] ≤ 0 = off (≤ 1.7.7 behaviour: one shared limit).
